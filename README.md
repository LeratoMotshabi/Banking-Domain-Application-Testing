# Banking-Domain-Application-Testing

This project demonstrates banking domain application testing.
The project showcases my understanding of Selenium WebDriver with java, data-driven automation, and Page object model.
It is integrated with extent reports and it tests features like adding customers, opening an account, depositing an amount, withdrawing an amount, deleting a customer, and verifying deleted customer names.
